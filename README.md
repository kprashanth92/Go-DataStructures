# Go-DataStructures

1. Bubble Sort Algorithm 

{1, 3, 2, 4, 8, 6, 7, 2, 3, 0}

first compares 1 and 3. they are sorted. Next compares 3 and 2. They are unsorted So they are swapped. 
After swapping n times it will push the largest number to end and array looks as following

{1,2,3,4,6,7,2,3,0,8}

now again start from the first. Recursive Swapping will push 7 to last. 

{1,2, 3, 4, 6, 2,3, 0 , 7 , 8}
